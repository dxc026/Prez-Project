# Presidents

This week's group project was to create a Slide Show application featuring all the United States Presidents. For the application we created a gallery of the Presidents in term number order with a portrait of them. Along with each portrait was a button that when clicked, would take you to their page. Each President has a page which lists their term number, their name, term dates, their photo and a fun fact unique to each President. HTML/CSS was utilized to format the overall layout and graphical representation. JSP and Java servlets as well as Maven were used to provide the overall logic and backbone for the project. The functionality navigating between pages, the searching by term number and the overall connection between backend and frontend was handled by our president.jsp, president servlet and all our DAO interfaces.
